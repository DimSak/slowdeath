= Description =

Slowdeath is a proof of concept tool to easily perform a denial of service 
attack on webservers, in particular ones that have a limited number of clients
available, such as Apache.

To use:

python slowdeath.py --threads 200 http://localhost/

The script will open 200 sockets to localhost, and perform a POST request. 
The connection is kept alive, and will send out small tcp packages in the 
request body.

If the server is configured for less than 200 clients, the number of
connections quickly exhausts, and the server will be unavailable for other
users.
